Business Context

The case study simulates a retail business environment where customer transactions are recorded across different store types and product categories.

	The main goal is to analyze:

•	Customer behavior (demographics, transactions, returns, frequency of purchase).

•	Product performance (sales, returns, revenue contribution by category/subcategory).

•	Store performance (which store type generates the most sales).

	Ultimately, the business wants insights that can help in:

•	Identifying profitable customers (e.g., frequent buyers, high-spending age groups).

•	Understanding product performance (e.g., Electronics, Books, Clothing).

•	Evaluating returns and losses.

•	Improving marketing, store strategy, and inventory planning.

Available Data

Based on the SQL queries, three main tables are being used:

	Customer1
   
•	Attributes: customer_id, DOB, Gender, City_code, etc.

•	Captures customer demographic information.

•	Used for segmentation (age, gender, city distribution).

	prod_Cat
   
•	Attributes: prod_cat_code, prod_subcat_code, prod_cat, prod_subcat.

•	Defines the hierarchy of products into categories and subcategories.

•	Useful for revenue contribution analysis.

	Transaction
   
•	Attributes: transaction_id, cust_id, tran_date, store_type, prod_cat_code, prod_subcat_code, Qty, total_amt.

•	Captures sales and returns (positive Qty = purchase, negative Qty = return).

•	Key for revenue, return, and frequency analysis.
